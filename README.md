This repository contains my coding dojo exercises. You can find the description of the different exercises under the [`exercises`](https://github.com/ZsoltFabok/dojo.exercises/tree/master/exercises) folder.

The solutions are kept in different kinds of branches so that you can do your exercises using a clean base.
